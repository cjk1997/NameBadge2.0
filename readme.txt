Name Card Assignment

1. I used the btnClicked event to trigger the text from the text field being
put on the card.
2. I linked the HTML at the very end of the body section. This is the best place
because you want the animation and events to take place after the data has 
finished loading and the content is all there.
3. Storing JS/CSS in separate files not only allows your structure document to
remain less cluttered but it also allows for a separation of concerns. Styling 
in one, JS in another, and HTML in its own allows the developer to more easily
alter the code.
